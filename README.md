## This is a repository for simulations of various Physics equations that I'm learning in my Physics class.

- I have one so far, which renders the position of a particle given the initial position and velocity on the X and Y axes. It uses the Curses library to draw the particle's curve. A position trace mode can be enabled if you want to see it as a parabola.
- As I learn more Physics equations, I'll add simulations of the most interesting ones to this repository.
